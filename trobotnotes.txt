The Shotgun's spread is narrower close to the player. Try to keep enemies at a medium distance.

Stay away from the "!" on the sides of the screen. Enemies spawn there.

Maximize the Shotgun's effectiveness by waiting for groups to fire upon.

When surrounded, shoot the same direction you are moving to make a hole through your foes.

Watch out, past 500 kills there are enemies that are faster than you!

All weapons (except the Machinegun) can be fired faster by tapping the arrow keys instead of holding them down.

Pay attention to the colors of enemies. Darker enemies run faster.

Always keep an eye on the ammo of your weapon. Don't run out at the wrong moment!

You can pause at any time with Spacebar

You can switch between weapons with 1,2,3,4. Q and "End" will switch between the pistol and special weapons. 

You can switch weapons while paused.
